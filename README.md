This repository is an aggregation of the following repositories made for consumption by [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt). All the repositories have been merged into one another properly (`git merge --allow-unrelated-histories`), so history was preserved

- [bats-support](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-support)

- [bats-file](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-file)

For each of those repositories, issues and PRs have been piling up; in the future this repository will address them since the original repositories do not seem to be fully maintained
